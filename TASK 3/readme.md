## Path Planning Approach
We use a simplified Dijkstra Algorithm.A Dijkstra Algorithm basically works as follows:We keep calculating distances from a fixed vertex to another vertex .We keep updating the distance with the least distance found yet.We maintain two arrrays of visited and unvisited vertices , and then keep transferrinf vertices one by one from unvisited to visited array.
